# ML
Google Colab notebooks are saved here as a record to track my learning progress in machine learning.

Current .ipynb notebooks uploaded use the following ML types to train models:
- Binary classification
- Multilabel classification
- Unsupervised clustering
- CNN Image Classification

Some techniques used throughout these notebooks are:
- Transfer Learning
- Data Augmentation
- K-means clustering
- Oversampling imbalanced datasets
- Regularization
